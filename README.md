# Project Name: Gadget Heaven



#### In the Gadget Heaven project, the Context API is used to manage global data, like the cart, across components without needing to pass props deeply. This keeps the code clean and allows real-time updates. The Context API simplifies state sharing, making data easily accessible to components like Product, Cart, and Dashboard, ensuring a smooth user experience.
## Technology used:

- **HTML**
- **Tailwindcss+DaisyUI**
- **React**
- **React Router and nested route**

## React Fundamental concepts used in the project:
**1. Components –** Reusable UI building blocks that encapsulate structure and behavior.

**2. State and Props –** Core tools for managing and passing dynamic data between components.

**3. Hooks (useState, useEffect) –** Essential for handling state and side effects like data fetching.

**4. React Router –** Enables client-side routing for seamless navigation between pages (e.g., product details, categories).

**5. Nested Routing –** Allows sub-routes within main routes, enabling a consistent layout (like displaying FilteredProduct alongside category buttons) without full page reloads.

**6. Context API –** Simplifies state management by providing a global state, like the cart, accessible across components.

**7. Event Handling –** Captures user interactions (e.g., category clicks) to trigger dynamic UI updates.

**8. Conditional Rendering –** Dynamically displays components based on conditions, such as filtered product lists. **etc.**
## 5 Features of this website:
**1. Product Categories –** Users can explore gadgets organized into categories like mobiles, accessories, laptops, and more.

**2. Dynamic Filtering –** Products are filtered dynamically by category, displaying only relevant items without reloading the page.

**3. Cart Management –** Users can add, view, and remove items from their cart with data managed through the Context API for smooth updates. Also prevent users multiple time adding wishlist the same products.

**4. Responsive Design –** The layout adjusts for different screen sizes, ensuring a seamless experience on mobile, tablet, and desktop.

**5. Detailed Product Pages –** Each product has a dedicated page with details like specifications, price, and reviews, helping users make informed choices. **etc.**
